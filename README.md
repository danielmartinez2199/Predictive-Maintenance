# Predictive Maintenance of Machines using Time Series Based Forecasting

## Description
This project aims to perform predictive maintenance in the context of machine data analysis. It includes a Python-based code that analyzes machine data and utilizes time series-based forecasting techniques to predict machine failures. The project utilizes various datasets related to machine errors, failures, telemetry, and maintenance. The code follows a step-by-step approach for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, and the creation of a time series forecast model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

## Installation
To run the project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
